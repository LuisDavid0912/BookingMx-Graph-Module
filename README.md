## 🧪 Multi-Layered Testing Strategy (Sprint 1)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
We implemented a **two-layer testing architecture** to validate both business logic and persistence.

---

### 🧱 Layer 1: Unit Tests (Mocking)

**Purpose:** Validate the *business logic* in `ReservationService` without hitting a real DB.  
**Tool:** Mockito  
**Coverage:** 97% instruction, 100% branch coverage.

**Diagram: Unit Testing Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Test Environment (Unit)"
        A[ReservationServiceTest] -- 1. Injects Mock --> B((ReservationRepository Mock))
        A -- 2. Calls method --> C(ReservationService)
        B -- 3. Returns mock data --> C
    end

    subgraph "Application"
        C -- Depends on --> D[ReservationRepository Interface]
    end

    A -- 4. Asserts results --> E(Test Passed/Failed);
```

---

### 🧩 Layer 2: Integration Tests (MySQL Database)

**Purpose:** Validate **real SQL logic** in `JdbcReservationRepository`.  
**Tool:** MySQL (real local DB) + Maven Failsafe.  
**Goal:** Ensure queries like `findById` and `isRoomAvailable` run correctly in a true DB context.  
**Execution:** Automatically runs during Maven’s `verify` phase.

---

## 🖼️ Database Insertion Proof (MySQL)

To confirm that **data persistence works correctly**, an integration test inserts a sample reservation and verifies it in MySQL.

✅ **Example Query Output:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM reservations;
```

**Expected Result:**
| id | guest_name | room_number | check_in | check_out |
|----|-------------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 1  | John Doe    | 101         | 2025-11-01 | 2025-11-03 |

# Sprint 2: Development & Decision Log

This file documents the technical difficulties and strategies used for the JavaScript portion of the challenge, as required by the Sprint 2 deliverables.

### 1. Challenge: Establishing a C2 "Quality Gate"

* **Problem:** How do we ensure that all future code contributions (from any collaborator) meet our 90% coverage goal?
* **Strategy:** We established a "Quality Gate" directly within the `package.json` file.
* **Implementation:** We added a `"jest"` block:
    ```json
    "jest": {
      "coverageThreshold": {
        "global": {
          "branches": 90,
          "lines": 90,
          "statements": 90,
          "functions": 90
        }
      }
    }
    ```
* **Result:** The `npm test` command now serves as our all-in-one quality check. It will automatically fail the build if coverage drops below 90%, which is exactly what happened during our initial test run (it failed at 50% coverage), proving the system works.

### 2. Challenge: Cross-Platform Compatibility (Mac/Windows)

* **Problem:** How to ensure the project runs identically on Luis's Mac (VS Code) and Diego's Windows (IntelliJ).
* **Strategy:** We used `npm` and the `package.json` file as our "universal contract," just as we used `pom.xml` for the Java project.
* **Implementation:**
    1.  **`package.json`:** Defines the exact `devDependencies` (Jest).
    2.  **`package-lock.json`:** This file (which *is* committed to Git) locks the exact dependency versions, ensuring Diego installs the same Jest version as Luis.
    3.  **`.gitignore`:** This file ignores `node_modules`, `coverage/`, and OS-specific files, keeping the repository clean.

### 3. Challenge: Achieving 100% Branch Coverage

* **Problem:** Our initial "happy path" test only covered 50% of the code branches (it missed the `if (!graph[startCity])` check).
* **Strategy:** We implemented Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. We wrote two new "edge case" tests specifically to target the uncovered code.
* **Implementation:**
    1.  `test('...should return an empty array for a non-existent city')`
    2.  `test('...should return an empty array for invalid input (null)')`
* **Result:** These two tests forced the code coverage to 100% and ensure the module is resilient against bad or unexpected data, fulfilling the Sprint 2 requirement.



## 🔑 C2 Improvement: Secure Credential Management


Problem: You must never save passwords or usernames in source code (git). It's a major security risk and breaks collaboration (e.g., Diego has different credentials than Luis).

Solution: We use Environment Variables.

The test code JdbcReservationRepositoryIT.java is "agnostic" and reads credentials using System.getenv("DB_USER_TEST").

Each developer sets these variables on their own local machine.

The CI/CD pipeline reads them from encrypted GitHub Secrets.

This is an innovative and secure procedure that ensures the project is both safe and scalable for any number of collaborators.


## 🤖 Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

This repository is automated with **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

🔁 **Workflow Tasks:**
1. Trigger on each `push` to `main` or `dev-david`.
2. Set up Ubuntu VM with Java 17 + Maven.
3. Securely Injects the DB_USER_TEST and DB_PASSWORD_TEST credentials from GitHub Secrets.
4. Runs the full C2 build command:
   ```bash
   mvn clean verify
   ```
5. Execute all **12 tests** (8 Unit + 4 Integration).
6. Enforce **Quality Gate** → Build fails if coverage < 90%.

## 🏃 How to Run the Project Locally

### ⚙️ Requirements
- Java JDK 11 or higher
- Apache Maven
- MySQL Server running locally

---

Before running the tests, you must set the environment variables that your Java code will read.

A) On your Mac (Terminal): (These commands only last for your current terminal session)

Bash

export DB_USER_TEST="booking_tester"
export DB_PASSWORD_TEST="123456"
B) For Diego on Windows (Command Prompt):

DOS

set DB_USER_TEST="booking_tester"
set DB_PASSWORD_TEST="123456"
(Note: Ensure your local MySQL server is running and the bookingmx schema and user exist).

🔬 2. Run the FULL Pipeline (Unit + Integration Tests)
Once your variables are set, run this command in the same terminal:

Bash

mvn clean verify
This command runs all 12 tests and applies all quality checks, exactly like the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

✅ Expected Output:

[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0
